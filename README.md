# Keepalived - High Availability and Load Balancing for Linux

Keepalived is a powerful tool for providing **high availability** and **load balancing** in Linux environments. It is commonly used to ensure redundancy and failover for critical infrastructure by leveraging the **VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)**. This repository contains configurations, examples, and guides for setting up and using Keepalived in various scenarios.
